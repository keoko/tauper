# Tauper

Tauper is a real-time multiplayer chemistry quiz game built with Elixir and Phoenix LiveView. Players compete by answering questions about chemical elements (symbols, names, and valences) as quickly as possible, earning points based on their speed and accuracy.

## Features

- Real-time multiplayer gameplay using Phoenix LiveView
- Dynamic game sessions managed with OTP GenServers
- Live player presence tracking
- Time-based scoring system
- Internationalization support (Catalan and English)
- Question types: element symbols, names, and valence states

## Prerequisites

- Elixir ~> 1.12
- Erlang/OTP
- direnv (optional, for environment management)

## Setup

Install dependencies:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mix deps.get
#+END_SRC

Or use the setup alias:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mix setup
#+END_SRC

## Development

Start the Phoenix server:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mix phx.server
#+END_SRC

The application will be available at [[http://localhost:4000][http://localhost:4000]]

Development tools:
- LiveDashboard: [[http://localhost:4000/dashboard][http://localhost:4000/dashboard]]
- Email preview: [[http://localhost:4000/dev/mailbox][http://localhost:4000/dev/mailbox]]

## Testing

Run the test suite:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mix test
#+END_SRC

## Translations

Extract and merge translation strings:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mix gettext.extract --merge
#+END_SRC

Translation files are located in =priv/gettext/=.

## Deployment

Deploy to fly.io:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
fly deploy
#+END_SRC

Build assets for production:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mix assets.deploy
#+END_SRC

## Architecture

The application uses OTP principles for game state management:

- Each game runs as an isolated GenServer process
- Games are supervised by a DynamicSupervisor
- Player presence is tracked via Phoenix.Presence
- Real-time updates broadcast via Phoenix.PubSub
- No database - all state is in-memory

See [[file:CLAUDE.md][CLAUDE.md]] for detailed architecture documentation.
